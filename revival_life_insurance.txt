what if?

-what if humans were only fertile for one year?
-what if the human brain became a collective?
-what if humans figured out the higher order of things?
-what if they didn’t?
-what if there was no scarcity?


-what if humans couldn’t die - or if they did, they could always come back?
	-would there be a need for birth?
	-how would it affect society? religion? politics?
	-how would it affect everyday life?
	-martial arts - sparring would be lethal? bloodsports?
	-what’s the dark side of all of this?
	-would there be people who wanted death? who couldn’t afford life?
	-life would be a commodity….taken for granted? killing would increase? murder would not be a crime?
	-how would it work if you got really hurt - lost an arm, etc? would it be rapid regeneration, or would it be something like, you just get revived?
	-how would the economic divide factor into this? the haves and the have nots?
	-“revival”
	-perhaps humans are granted a number of lives - as an insurance policy! “life insurance”.
	-how widespread would this be? people buying life insurance for their kids?
	-what if you somehow became desensitized to death - not externally, but interally? most people have an anti-death reflex, but what if you didn’t because of how it worked?
	-“first death”?
	-death no longer a taboo subject? trivial?
	-would you still age normally….? would there be a separate plan for advanced age?
	-scaremongering. “how many things could kill you today?” advertising.

-how would it work?
	-legal death vs clinical death, scientific advancements allow death for up to five days
	-combination of freezing, cardiac stimulation, implants…?
	-would the medicorps know that you're dead when you die? it would make sense that they would track your vitals somehow, meaning a quick dispatch.

-Would there be a price to die?
-What if you went to a spa to die?

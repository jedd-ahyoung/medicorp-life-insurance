As I tapped fists with my opponent, all I could think about was the fact that I was uninsured.

They'd dropped me. They'd fucking dropped me. After all the work I put in, the sweat, the injuries - the lives I'd spent doing this. _The fights,_ they said, _they're not raw enough - they're not pulling in the numbers._  And so they'd dropped me like a used tissue.

I'd gotten mad, lunged across the desk, and slammed Marco in his pizza-dough face. He'd been livid. _It's gonna be your last fight_, he'd yelled. I'd raised my chin in defiance, inviting him and the rest of the world to suck my balls. So they'd put me in a death match. And nobody knew. Only the bookers, the house team. They were all in on it, this sick joke. The audience thought it was business as usual.

But now that I was here, face-to-chin with Frank - known in crowd circles as Freight-Train Frank - I was regretting my bravado.

_Bing._ The match started. 

------------

I faced Frank in a low crouch. Our eyes locked, and in that moment, time seemed to stretch for an eternity. I could see the sweat on his skin - hear his ragged breathing mingling with mine, a strange syncopated antirhythm. 

I was dogged. Frank was determined to take my life. I was breathing hard, muscles aching with the pain of fatigue. Yet, that coil of white-hot fear drove me to fight more. And that's when I realized - this was primal. I'd never feared death, not when it was merely an inconvenience. I'd never really given it much thought. But now, with death so close, I realized - I didn't want to die.

Shit. I don't want to die.


Round four.

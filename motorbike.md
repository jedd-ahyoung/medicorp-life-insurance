	An onslaught of wind buffets his naked cheeks as he weaves through the  terrain - wheeled, metal dinosaurs on an endless march to nowhere. While they amble, he sprints; threading his way nimbly through the nooks and crannies, cracks and craters in the endless pattern. Slowing is not an option, so he makes his own way; sometimes a downshift to make a pass, a quick flick of the wrist to fall into a crevice. All of this at breakneck speeds, where the tiniest mistake could kill.
	But that didn't matter. All Johnny cares about is the thrill. All Johnny has ever cared about is the thrill. The thrill is everything. And if Johnny can't race, Johnny can't live.

	A brief flash of yellow ahead, spotted briefly amidst the shifting terrain. Its flitting through the cracks as he is; it's his target, the reason for the risk. He accelerates, going faster, carving his own paths between the deadly behemoths - but no matter how he manuevers, it always seems to slip away from him; it manages to stay ahead of him. Until he sees an opportunity.

	At breakneck speeds, Johnny squeezes through split-second spaces, knowing that if he can just make it this one time, he can overtake - it's within his grasp. Fear, exhilaration, adrenaline - the thrill. A flick here, a quick shift. He's getting closer. Dart into an emerging crack in the surrounding walls of metal. He's almost there. Predict a lane shift, speed past the obstruction. Almost there. The sensation of flying --

	Pain. A shock of light - the azure sky above clashes with the crimson on the pavement. A shadow appears above him, obscuring the sun; the face is obscured, but the voice is clear. It is laughing.
	"Dude. You really got toasted."
	Johnny's eyes adjust to reveal the familiar windblown hair, the rumpled yellow t-shirt - the impish grin. Alex had won again. 
	"You know if you keep doing this, your insurance premiums are gonna go way up. I mean, you barely got your life back a week ago..."
	The pain, and the light, is receding. Johnny can hear sirens in the distance - the medicorps - but he knows they won't be here in time to stabilize him. Alex regards Johnny's broken body with calm eyes - the same color as the sky.
	"So what is this now, seven times you've died trying to beat me? It's not happening, man. Take your next life and give it up."
	Johnny chuckles, as death slowly takes him. "Fuck you, Alex. Next weekend, same time."

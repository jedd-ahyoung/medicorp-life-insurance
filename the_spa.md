The Spa
=======

"Mary, you have got to try it at least once."

Jennifer sipped at her glass of wine. "Seriously. How long has it been since you've had a spa day?"

Mary sighed, sinking back into her chair. It had been a while, she mused. When was the last time she'd actually relaxed? Since she'd had her third child, time was becoming more and more scarce - and she was feeling it.

"I don't know, Jen." She absentmindedly picked at a hanging fingernail. "I can't really afford to just take a week away from John and the kids."

"Listen, lady, you need time to relax. Plus, it's a plus-one, and it'd be such a shame for the ticket to go to waste...."

--------

The glass doors parted with a soft hiss as Mary entered the lobby. Sunlight streamed through the overhead skylight, and the air felt cool upon her face as she surveyed her surroundings. She'd known that the spa was expensive, but she hadn't imagined it'd be so nice. The faint scent of juniper ticked her nose - then she felt a tap on her shoulder.

"Ready for the getaway?" Jen asked. "C'mon, let's check in."

-------

"Close your eyes, and relax. I'll see you in a week." Immersed in the spa, they floated, suspended in snow-white cocoons. Mary's lids became heavy - her breathing slowed, and deepened. Silence fell, except for the beating of her heart.

Beat. Beat. Beat. Beat.

Her lids became heavier, as she floated.

Beat. Beat. Beat.

Images floated before her. Her children - her husband. Beat. Their first date, when he'd tripped over a rock while hiking. Beat. Her first pregnancy, and the excitement of expectation. Beat. A childhood memory of strong arms lifting her towards the sky.

Beat.

A distant voice. "Heart rate dropping. Prepare for process."

The last image - her mother's face - faded as Mary's heart stopped.

-------

Over the next five days, some stuff happened. Describe the process, or no? No complications....yet.

-------

"Checking out?" The receptionist greeted Mary at the front desk. "We hope you had a wonderful stay with us."

"I've never felt so relaxed!"

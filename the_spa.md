The Spa
=======

"Mary, you have got to try it at least once."

Jennifer sipped at her glass of wine. "Seriously. How long has it been since you've had a spa day?"

Mary sighed, sinking back into her chair. It had been a while, she mused. When was the last time she'd actually relaxed? Lately, between trying to be a good mother to the kids, and the part-time work, her free time had shriveled away to nearly nothing. Not that she regretted her decisions, but it would be nice to take a break. But this...

"I don't know, Jen." Mary absentmindedly picked at a hanging fingernail. "I can't really afford to just take a week away from John and the kids."

"Yeah, you can. You've got the vacation time, Em." Jennifer turned to choose another bottle of wine from her collection - she chose a Reisling - and continued to speak as she refilled Mary's glass. "Look - you know you need this, and you're going to feel so great afterwards. You've gotta take care of yourself, first, y'know?"

Mary's eyes became distant. "Yeah..."

Jennifer wasn't wrong. But it wasn't the same thing for her, not at all. But then, it never had been, had it? Where Mary was a working mother of three, Jennifer was a housewife of none. Mary was the short to Jennifer's statuesque, the responsible to Jen's carefree - and lately, Mary had been the lassitude to Jennifer's vivacity. I used to be like that, Mary thought. What happened?

Jennifer interrupted her reverie. "Listen," she said. "I can't decide for you, but it's this weekend, and I think you need this. Plus, it's a buy-one-get-one deal, so I mean..." Her earrings swung like tiny pendulums as she shook her head. "I guess maybe Jill could go."

In that moment, something changed. Mary wasn't sure why, but a spark of her old life touched her, and she remembered what she'd been. She come to a decision and tossed back her wine. "Y'know what? Yeah, I'll go."

The glass doors parted with a soft hiss as Mary entered the lobby. Sunlight streamed through the overhead skylight, and the air felt cool upon her face as she surveyed her surroundings. She'd known that the spa was expensive, but she hadn't imagined it'd be so nice. The faint scent of juniper ticked her nose - then she felt a tap on her shoulder.

"Ready for the getaway?" Jen asked. "C'mon, let's check in."

"Close your eyes, and relax. I'll see you in a week." Immersed in the spa, they floated, suspended in snow-white cocoons. Mary's lids became heavy - her breathing slowed, and deepened. Silence fell, except for the beating of her heart.

Beat. Beat. Beat. Beat.

Her lids became heavier, as she floated.

Beat. Beat. Beat.

Images floated before her. Her children - her husband. Beat. Their first date, when he'd tripped over a rock while hiking. Beat. Her first pregnancy, and the excitement of expectation. Beat. A childhood memory of strong arms lifting her towards the sky.

Beat.

A distant voice. "Heart rate dropping. Prepare for process."

The last image - her mother's face - faded as Mary's heart stopped.

-------

Over the next five days, some stuff happened. Describe the process, or no? No complications....yet.

"Checking out?" The receptionist greeted Mary at the front desk. "We hope you had a wonderful stay with us."

"I did - I feel refreshed, almost like I'm a new person!" Mary beamed.

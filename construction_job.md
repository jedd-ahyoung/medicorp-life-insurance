Construction Job
================

As he lay dying, Greg could only think about how close he'd gotten.

He'd taken the construction job with little notice. On a whim, really. The opportunity bloomed like the first butterfly in spring - miraculous, an incredible thing in a bleak landscape of sadness and despair. It wasn't much, but he'd walked into the employment office in his best attire - his best attire had matched the tattered office decor, he'd noticed - and asked for the job. Well, begged, really.

He hadn't had insurance. The construction company that the employment office supplied required all prospective employees to be insured. He remembered the lady behind the desk - layers of cheap mascara had framed resigned, disinterested eyes, that had seen and heard it all - he remembered her words. _We don't hire corpses,_ she'd said. He'd attempted to persuade - then intimidate - then negotiate. She'd allowed him to see the boss once he'd offered to work for a quarter of the regular wage.

And now he was here.

It wasn't a stinging pain. Rather, it was the type of pain that spread slowly - blossomed, really, like a fungus, from your heart and then grew through your body, sprouting mushrooms at every nerve, exuding spores at all of the orifices and extremities - the pain that consumed, like fire, every portion of the body until nothing was left. And amidst this pain lay Greg's consciousness, bathed in a morass of red-hot heat, bombarded by an assault of screaming nerve endings.

Dammit, he'd been so close.

He hadn't had insurance. For six months, he'd scrimped and saved for the larger goal - the six-month plan, knowing that the investment could help him bootstrap his income. He'd taken the dangerous jobs - the jobs that, with insurance, were merely an annoyance, an inconvenience at worst. They'd paid better - even at a quarter of the normal income. After getting insured, he'd be earning full pay, he'd be opening doors previously closed to him.

He'd been so close.

He tried to muster a cry for help as his foreman approached his broken body, but he could only muster a small groan. The other workers were laughing at his plight. [[ Flesh this out. ]]
